# Hyprland Dotfiles

## Overview
This repository manages the dotfiles for my hyprland setup. The setup is build on **ArchLinux** using the **Hyprland** wayland compositor which is a keyboard-centric workflow to maximize screen real estate and efficiency. It is styled with the **Gruvbox** color scheme.

## Architecture
* **OS** - Arch Linux
* **Compositor** - Hyprland (Wayland)
* **Bar** - Waybar (Custom JSON modules & CSS styling)
* **Terminal** - st
* **Shell** - Zsh (Managed via Oh-My-Zsh)
* **Notification Daemon** - Dunst

## Key Features
* **Automated Tiling** - Custom window rules defined in `hyprland.conf` to automatically tile windows and tools while floating diagnostic windows.
* **System Monitoring** - Waybar configured to display cpu/ram usage and essential for monitoring system resources.
* **Workflow Optimization** - Keybindings mapped for quick workspace switiching and application launching.
